# CognifyAI
HackGT 12.0 Hackathon Project

This project was created to reimagine the field sobriety test in a more accessible and tech-driven way. Current road side tests rely mainly on human abilities and they are decided by the police officers discretion. Our application uses a combination of computer vision, speech analysis, and performance of tasks to give a more reliable evaluation of sobriety through coordination, speech, and balance.

Our main goals:
- Early detection is our main goal to reduce impaired driving and keep as many people safe as possible
- Increase consistency and reduce human error
- Allow anybody, such as researchers or students, to study or practice impairment detection outside of just a police environment
- Allow for more research and an extension to further studies, such as fatigue

Main Technologies Used:
-Next.js
-Shadcn UI
-React TS
-Python
-MediaPipe
-Ngrok

Dependencies:
- You can easily install all the needed Python libraries with "pip install i"
- We used Ngrok to be able to use the camera on our phone while still running the code locally, "npm install ngrok"
